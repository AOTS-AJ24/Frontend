<!--   here what we are mainly figuring out is relative units as compared to absolute units in css 
        As 50%  here we tak it in consideration to not whole page but the parent div above -->

        <!-- that is nose ,11,12, mouth will be relative to the width-height of face & not relative to entire page width-Height -->
